It was one of the years of the frontier epoch, fast drawing to a close in American history.  Families had followed the dream of new and free lands in the west.\r\n\r\nThe Cheyenne-Arapaho lands were opened for settlement in 1892.  Charles and Dora Wilkinson had loaded their belongings in a wagon and headed for these newly-opened lands in western Oklahoma from their home near Bethany, Missouri.\r\n\r\nThey had two daughters, Pearl and Goldie, and soon a son, Claude, was born in a dugout on the farm two miles south of Hitchcock where they settled.  The family later moved to a farm one mile east of Watonga.\r\n\r\nIt was there, on May 30, 1902, that the family heralded the birth of a second son, Guy Elgin.  The house in which he was born is part of the rock facade house still facing Hwy 33 east of Watonga.\r\n\r\nIn 1905 Dora Alice Wilkinson died of tuberculosis, despite having taken special trips to Colorado to seek relief.  Guy was three years old when his mother died and four when his father re-married.  His step-mother, the former Amelia “Molly” Weitz, was from a German immigrant family who had come to America from the Ukraine in southern Russia.\r\n\r\nThe family soon grew with the births of Opal, Thelma, Melvin and Beatrice.\r\n\r\nGuy first attended school in Watonga, then the family moved to farms in the Cordell School District southeast of Watonga for about three years.  He spent part of one grade in Collinsville, when he lived with his oldest sister, Pearl, and her husband, Lee Boughton.\r\n\r\nAs a boy Guy worked on the farm.  They lived near town, and his father sometimes contracted with townspeople to graze their milk cows.  Guy’s job was to move the cows out to pasture each morning and return them to their owners in the evening.\r\n\r\nThe family next moved to Hitchcock, where his father managed a livery stable owned by his brother, John.  Guy attended grades 6-7 and part of the eighth grade there.\r\n\r\nAt that point, at age 15 in 1918, he went to work on the farm of W.H. Oler in the Cordell area.  He earned $25 a month with room and board, that began a series of farm jobs over the next four years with time out for some adventures in other states.\r\n\r\nIn 1919 his brother Claude, recently discharged from the Army, worked on a ranch in Littleton, Colorado, and Guy joined him in August.  They then went to Ranger, Texas where their sister Goldie lived and her husband Clarence “Rags” Lewis worked as a boilermaker in the oil fields.  Guy was a boilermaker’s helper and he and Claude lived in a tent in the backyard of the Lewis’ shack.  Ranger was then a “boom town”.\r\n\r\nClaude’s health was deteriorating from tuberculosis so they bought a team and covered wagon to go to New Mexico.  They started west on April 1, 1920, eating around the campfire and sleeping in the wagon.  Rainy, cold weather stopped them in Lubbock, Texas where they turned and headed for Watonga because of Claude’s health.  The trip took over a month.  Their father was running the county “poor farm” at that time but he shortly moved to a farm just northeast of Watonga.  Claude died there in the spring of 1921.\r\n\r\nThat summer Guy and his father started for Colorado in a covered wagon but at Guymon decided to work the harvest at Meade, Kansas.  After a few days there they changed their minds again and headed back to Woodward.  From there Guy rode on horseback to Buffalo where he worked in the harvest while his father returned home.  \r\n\r\nThe harvest season moved to Elkhart, Kansas and after that he headed west across the plains and worked as a hand on a ranch north of Pagosa Springs, Colorado.  He herded the cattle to the grassy meadows in the higher elevations and during haying season helped fork and haul hay for winter feed.\r\n\r\nIn spring 1922 Guy left to visit Rags and Goldie Lewis, who had been farming near Delores, Colorado but he learned that they had moved to Augusta, Kansas.  He stayed with their neighbors, Pete and Clyde Solomon, originally from Watonga, and worked on road construction.  Then he worked with a flume crew on a power generator before leaving for Pueblo, Colorado.  He sold his horse for a train fare.\r\n\r\nIn Pueblo he and another former Watongan, a Mr. Sallie, hopped a freight train for Kansas.  Cold and black from riding in a coal car, Guy got off in Wichita and then went on to Augusta to stay with the Lewises while he shoveled coal in an ice plant.\r\n\r\nAfter Christmas he left for Emporia, Kansas where former Hitchcock friends were working on the railroad.  But he went on the Ridgeway, Missouri where his grandfather, John Porter Simpson and his two sons operated an 800-acrea farm.  He worked there that winter but the next summer, 1923, he returned to Blaine County and worked for Mr. Falkenstein near Hitchcock driving a Rumley one-cylinder kerosene tractor, one of the few there.\r\n\r\nGuy bought a 1923 Model-T Ford for $200 and with his father went to Casper, Wyoming in 1924.  He unloaded railroad box cars for about three months and then left for McCracken, Kansas where Rags and Goldie were working on a wildcat drilling rig.  He also worked there.\r\n\r\nIn 1925 he came back to Watonga and worked on his father’s farm southwest of town, the “Phillips place”.  At this time he learned that his deceased brother Claude had named him beneficiary of his veteran benefits and received a lump sum in back pay owed and also monthly checks of $56.  He used the money to buy the home farm 12 miles southwest of Watonga in December 1925.  Land prices were down after the post WWI boom as many farmers had been forced to sell their farms or face foreclosure. \r\n\r\nThe first year the farm had about 40 acres broken, planted to corn, kafir corn and hay.  A hail storm in July nearly wiped out the corn.  Guy milked about half a dozen cows and had three horses, about a dozen sheep, two or three hogs and a few chickens.\r\n\r\nGuy turned 24 in 1926 and with the purchase of a farm was ready to settle down.  A dark-haired girl who had returned with her family from Kansas moved to a farm a couple of miles away.  After a brief courtship, Guy and 18-year-old Opal Ellen Gooch were married in the Watonga Presbyterian parsonage on December 11, 1926.\r\n\r\nWithin a year a son was born.  He was named Guy Jr. but he was given a different middle name, Ernest.  He was called Junior.  In a little more than a year later a daughter was born and named for Guy’s mother Dora with the middle name of Jean.  Three years later came a second daughter, Geraldine Babette.  Three years later came another son, John Preston, named for Guy’s two grandfathers John Parsons Wilkinson and John Porter Simpson.  \r\n\r\nThe farm had a two-room house on it’s northeast corner.  A new house was built on a hill a quarter mile west.  This white bungalow with three bedrooms was large by comparison.  It featured a living and dining room connected by French doors, a kitchen and a bathroom where plumbing would be added later.  A screened porch was used for the milk separator and to store cream sold each week in Watonga.\r\n\r\nThe children attended the one-room Oak Grove School three miles away and later Union School until it was consolidated with Greenfield.\r\n\r\nFour years after John’s birth came another son, Garland Keith, named for Opal’s father Garland Vincent Gooch.  When yet another son was delivered a year and half later, Dr. Krebs again made the long trip to the Wilkinson farm.  After that son’s arrival Dr. Krebs had sat down to a meal prepared by a neighbor, Opal Howry, only to be interrupted to deliver a twin daughter.  The boy was named Claude for Guy’s brother, with the middle name of Allen and the girl was Caren Ann allowing their initials to be the same.\r\n\r\nGuy leased a quarter section just north of him and purchased in 1947 a 160-acre farm a mile east and two miles north and also leased 40 acres of Indian land.  A few years later he acquired another 160 acres a mile south and one-half west.  Wheat was a major crop in the sandy soil but other crops as well were planted.\r\n\r\nGuy has always been a dreamer about faraway places and new horizons.  On many occasions he regaled his children with stories of the wild west, mountains, bears, and a host of other wild animals.  Though for many years he would not leave the farm, the wanderer’s lust reestablished itself and he and Opal have taken numerous trips to the mountains of the west.\r\n\r\nThe dream of new horizons is strongly implanted.  This perhaps as much as anything else makes Guy the young 80 year old that he is.  The story is still being written...', 1, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, NULL, NULL, NULL, '2018-06-01 06:13:34', '2018-07-07 03:25:00'),

We got tired of Tarik and the camel guy and all the other people who were constantly asking us for money.\r\n\r\nNext Tarik took us to another pyramid with some tombs and hieroglyphs and more people bothering us for money. We also stopped at a carpet making school where they had some kids making carpets and then they would give you the hard sell. Kate shut them down pretty fast before they showed us too many carpets and got nasty. I had had enough of Tarik and we told him to take us to the hotel and end the tour which was only about half over. Had to fight with him a little too since I didn\'t want to reimburse him for some stuff that he said that he had paid for on the trip.\r\n\r\nThat evening went to Pizza Hut and more people latched onto us and took us to a store where Kate bought a papyrus painting for 5 euro. She still thinks that she has to buy everything that they show us. Took a different way home from the Pizza Hut on the major streets and got lost. The streets were packed with people and it was hard to walk fast. Crossing the streets was also a hassle since you just have to wade into traffic and hope that they stop since there are no crosswalks. We walked through a few places where there were sidewak cafes and everybody was smoking the hukas.

Sometimes the driver was about to doze off and other times he was in a huge hurry and driving crazy. Finally got to Cairo about 5 hours later and the minibus stopped in the outskirts but luckily it was near a metro stop. Got on the subway and met a family of Christian Egyptians who started taking care of us. It was a young couple, their five year old, twin boys, and the wife\'s sister and father. The wife and sister latched onto Kate and soon started inviting us to their house. We declined a few times since it was already 9pm and we were exhausted from the road. They persisted and we finally gave in and went off to their house. They lived in Giza so we had a long subway ride from El Marg to Giza Suburban. From the subway stop, we took a tuktuk to their house. The house was run-down but huge and there were about 10 people living there.\r\n\r\nThe family was all over us, especially Kate. The ladies took her to a bedroom to comb her hair and feel her soft skin. The father help me wash up over a sink. I thought he might wash my hair for me. We had tea and then fruit and then they brought out the main spicy chicken dish with rice and pita bread. That all took a few hours. We showed them some of our pictures and they made Kate sing some Christian songs from her MP3. We took pictures with them and they asked us a million questions. Luckily the son and the brother in law could speak decent English.\r\n\r\nThe family wanted us to spend the night but Kate had had enough so we had to insist on leaving saying that we had already paid for the hotel, which was true. Earlier on they had told us that the father would take us back to the hotel but then we found out that he just had a moped. The new plan was for the father to take us to catch a taxi and we thought it would just be a quick ride to the taxi stop. The three of us hopped on the tiny moped with our big backpack and other bag and headed off at about 1am. There was a ton of traffic and it was a hectic ride on the back roads. Then daddy surprised us by getting on what looked like a freeway. He was weaving in and out of traffice while cars whizzed all around us and he just kept on going. We thought he was taking us all the way back to the hotel which was about 30km away but he finally stopped and let us off. I was practically sitting on the brake light and I was wondering the whole time what would happen if it snapped off and I was sent onto the pavement with all of the cars buzzing around. Kate seemed calm but as soon as we got in the taxi she had to take some hits off of her inhaler. The taxi ride was just over a buck and took about 10 minutes to get to our area and 10 more to find the street and hotel since the taxi driver didn\'t know where either. He tried to old Costa Rican taxi driver trick of shutting off the meter before could see the final total so we just paid him what we had last seen on the meter and he got a little excited but we walked away.\r\n\r\nWe got the huge master suite at the hotel, probably because there were no other rooms available at 1:30am on a Sunday.

The big Buddha was spectacular because he was built straight up one wall in a little cave so you had to look straight up to see his huge face.  The important caves had police and other guards.\r\n\r\nAfter the tour, I went to KFC for lunch because almost everything else was closed.  Then I found Bus 3 that goes to the Mingsha Shan desert and Crescent Moon Lake site.\r\n\r\nAt Mingsha Shan the lines were short so I got right in.  I went straight to the camel tour area where there were thousands of camels.  There was a line of camels circling through the desert as far as the eye could see almost.  Each group was four camels tied together using the rings in their noses with a guide leading the first camel.  I took a lot of fuzzy photos because of the camel rocking but it was great fun.\r\n\r\nAfter the camels I walked over to the crescent lake which was okay but no big deal.  Cloudy skies meant gray photos of everything.  Hundreds of people were climbing up the sand mountain but I wanted to save that for my 2nd visit and hopefully clearer skies.  The tickets allow visits for 3 days.\r\n\r\nI took the same bus back to Dunhuang and had dinner at the same meat pocket place from the night before.  I only had one fire sandwich this time and then had an ice cream afterward to put out the fire around my mouth.  When I was eating the ice cream some teenage girls came over to quiz me and try out their English.  They wanted to know where I was from, etc.  I made the main girl hold my ice cream while I showed them stuff on my phone such as where Seattle is, etc.  My China Unicom data plan had run out so I couldn\'t translate anything for them.', 1, 4, 66, 1, 1, 0, '2018-07-30', NULL, NULL, '2018-07-31 02:22:51', '2019-02-20 06:49:19'),

The second train was the 6 hour fast train to Urumqi so I wasn\'t sure that it left from the same station in Yumen but it did.  Usually the fast train is at a different station farther away.

At the train station I had to go through separate security for foreigners to be checked and double checked.  There was also a cop on the train who took my picture and a picture of my passport photo.  \r\n\r\nIn the city, there are metal detectors and security on the street and at all big stores and restaurants.  They don\'t do much good since the metal detectors always go off and the guards or cops just sit there.\r\n\r\nAnother difference in Urumqi is that there are far fewer scooters and electric bikes and there aren\'t separate bike-only side roads like in all the previous Chinese cities that I\'ve been to.\r\n\r\nThere was a KFC right around the corner from the hotel, the Jinjiang Inn Urumqi Hongqi Road, so I went there for a late dinner.', 1, 4, 63, 1, 1, 0, '2018-08-01', NULL, NULL, '2018-08-03 04:53:46', '2019-02-25 03:16:58'),

Use this to cross the border to Kazakhstan by foot. Takes about one hour after which you can walk to the border by foot in ten minutes. \r\n\r\nTo get from the bus station to the border, simply exit, turn right, and follow the main road until you cross a suspension bridge and see the chaos of the border.\r\n\r\nOnce through the Chinese passport control and customs you must use a bus to travel over the border for ¥20. Bribes appear to have been formalized so that you need to pay a further ¥20 after the bus departs. \r\n\r\nThere is no official money changer at Chinese side, but there are few guys exchanging yuan\'s to tenge and they will surely find you - you definitely need some tenge as there is nothing on Kazakh side - they actually had good exchange rate. \r\n\r\nYou are not able to go to the border customs without the bus ticket (you are not allowed to walk to between Kazakh and Chinese customs), not sure where tickets can be bought. \r\n\r\nOn Kazakh side there are taxis waiting, it cost 5000 Tenge/person to Almaty takes 6-8 hours (july 2016).\r\n\r\nDo not forget to ask for your (apparently) free registration at the Kazakh border, you need two stamps on your immigration card for this. Otherwise it costs 767 Tenge at least in Almaty, to register. It is not really necessary but can save you a lot of hassle with corrupt officials.\r\n\r\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\r\n\r\nYou can take a 09:00 AM bus from the Ili bus station (in the block east of the Tianma Lu / Jiefang Xi Lu crossing) in Yining. It will circle around from 08:30 to \"find\" passengers) which takes you to the bus station near the border in Khorgos around 10:45 (20 RMB). There it seems you have to buy a transport ticket for either a bus to Zharkent (70 RMB) or a shared taxi (? RMB). Please take my advice and opt for the latter as the bus left around 12:00 but finally left the border crossing at 14:30 Almaty time, so 16:30 Beijing time. So that\'s almost 6 hours for crossing a border as you have to wait for hours for bus passengers that simply don\'t show up anymore as they have changed to a faster mode of transport at one of the stops. Very frustrating. A shared taxi would have done that in maybe 1 to 1.5 hours instead of 6.\r\n\r\nFrom the empty field or so where the bus finally drops you off some cars go to Almaty and other places. I think (but I\'m not sure) from there the bus goes to the Zharkent bus station where you can take a cheap bus to Almaty. A shared car to Almaty is 4000 Tenge and since you\'ll be cooked by then I think it\'s a good option as it\'s 2-3 hours faster than by bus that you\'ll have to find first and/or may have to wait for for another couple of hours.\r\n\r\nThe shared taxi may find you already at the Kazakh border stop. If you can get it from there for 4000 Tenge do it as it saves you even more time.\r\n\r\nUsing the cheapish bus-bus-shared taxi-city bus combination I arrived in Almaty around 19:30. Had I used the shared taxi option from Khorgos to the field where the bus stops it may have been around 15:30.\r\n\r\nOh, one more thing: On the Kazakh side there seems to be nowhere to change Yuan into Tenge. On the Khorgos side there is and the money changers will find you between being dropped of by the bus from Yining and entering the transport station for the bus or shared taxi a minute later. DON\'T change all your Yuan as you\'ll have to change BACK from Tenge into Yuan to buy your ticket! So buy your ticket first and THEN head back to the guys to change the rest of your money. Currently the official rate is about 47 Tenge for 1 Yuan and you should be able to get about the same, which came as a positive surprise to me.', 1, 5, 0, 0, 0, 1, '2018-08-13', NULL, NULL, '2018-08-11 10:08:05', '2018-08-14 15:17:46'),

It has an excellent camera which takes very clear and detailed photos in any light.  The zoom creates pixelated photos so a DSLR camera with a zoom lens is better for zooming.  Almost all of the photos on the web site were taken with this camera.\r\n\r\nSpare cell phone instead of a battery bank - I use an extra cell phone instead of a portable battery pack because I always have a few laying around and they are about the same size and weight for packing.  An extra phone or battery is essential for those long travel days when you need the phone to find your way around when you arrive but you also want to listen to music all day while travelling.\r\n\r\nDigital SLR camera with zoom lens - I currently use a Canon EOS 1100D camera with a Tamron 18-200 MM lens.  I\'m not happy with it because it is so hard to get clear zoom and low light shots.  The non-zoomed and low-light photos with the Galaxy S9 are so much better than the Canon.\r\n\r\nLifeStraw Water Purifier - For those places where you don\'t want to drink the water, the LifeStraw is a life saver.  It is very lightweight for packing but it is a little hard to use because you have to suck the water through a thick filter.  These are easy to find at Amazon, Walmart and Target.  For long or multi-day hikes this is useful because if there is water available in rivers, etc. then you won\'t have to carry so much water.  I have also used it in sketchy places like India for brushing my teeth and making coffee when I run out of bottled water.\r\n\r\nZip off pants with zipper pockets - This is my favorite clothing item since they work as shorts or long pants.  The zipper pockets are essential to keep your valuables safe on crowded trains and to keep stuff from falling out of your pockets when reclining or laying down.  They are lightweight and dry very quickly so I also use them as a swimsuit.  With two pair of these, I don\'t need to carry any other pants, shorts, or a swimsuit.', 1, 5, 97, 1, 1, 0, '2018-10-12', NULL, NULL, '2018-09-29 09:36:20', '2019-02-24 21:34:13'),

Apps that work offline are noted and are very important when WiFi or cell service is not available.\r\n\r\nMaps.me maps (free, offline) - This is the most important app on my phone.  Popular landmarks, hotels, restaurants, etc are already marked on the maps and the app tracks your current position whether you are online or offline.  Maps obviously need to be downloaded in advance for offline access.  Maps.me also works in China where Google Maps is blocked.  [Click here to go to the download page for Maps.me](https://maps.me/).\r\n\r\nBooking.com (free) - Has the world\'s largest selection of online hotels.  Many hotels give a 10% discount for frequent bookers known on the site as \'Genius\' users.  Only two bookings in a two year period are needed to automatically become a genius user and qualify for discounts and other perks.  The other huge advantage of Booking.com is that the reservations are guaranteed and if the hotel doesn\'t have a room then you will be given an equivalent or better room at another hotel.  [Click Here to Book Hotels on Booking.com](https://www.booking.com/index.html?aid=1535306).\r\n\r\nPodcast Addict (free, offline) - Essential for providing free listening material for those long plane, train, and bus rides.  Thousands of podcasts are available for download.\r\n\r\nCurrency Plus currency converter (free, offline) - Outstanding tool to keep from getting ripped off when changing money in the street.  It shows exactly what rate you are getting and can display multiple currencies at the same time.\r\n\r\nGoogle Maps (free, offline) - Works well offline but doesn\'t work in China and in general isn\'t as nimble as Maps.me.  \r\n\r\nGoogle Translator (free, offline) - Languages can be pre-loaded for offline use.  The speech recognition is weak when there is a lot of ambient noise.  Doesn\'t work in China.\r\n\r\nExpedia.com (free) - Good app for booking flights mainly for prices and because it give you 24 hours to cancel a flight for free if your plans change.\r\n\r\nTrip.com (formerly CTrip, free) - Excellent for booking trains in China and flights in many other countries.  For trains, the service charge as a percentage seems a little hefty sometimes.  However the app is very useful to avoid language difficulties when buying tickets.  Tickets still have to be picked up at the train station but the agent just has to be given a reservation number.  For flights, the prices are very competitive compared to other services like Expedia.\r\n\r\nExpressVPN (free trial then monthly fee) - This is a must-have app in China to provide access to the many popular web sites such as Google, Facebook, Instagram, and YouTube that are blocked.  The app is also useful outside of China for example if you need to do online banking and you don\'t want your bank to freak out because the login attempt is coming from a strange country.  You can pick the country that you will appear to be connecting from.\r\n\r\nWikiloc (offline) - Has easy to follow GPS maps for hiking and biking trails all around the world.  Your location is shown on the trail map for easy offline navigation.\r\n\r\nWikiroutes (free) - Has bus route maps for many cities.\r\n\r\nPedometer Step Counter (free) - Throw away your battery sucking Fit Bit and start using this app to track your activity.  It may be a little less accurate than a dedicated step counter but it is consistent which is the most important factor.\r\n\r\nGoogle Voice (free) - Provides a free telephone number where you can be reached by phone or text message anywhere in the world.  It can also be used as your WhatsApp telephone number.\r\n\r\nLightning QR code reader (free) - Useful for places where WiFi passwords and other important information are provided as QR codes. \r\n\r\nNice To Haves\r\n\r\nAmazon Kindle (a few free books) - eBook provider and reader. \r\n\r\nAudible (free trial then monthly fee) - Audio book provider and reader.', 1, 5, 113, 1, 1, 0, '2018-09-29', NULL, NULL, '2018-09-29 09:52:25', '2019-02-18 06:40:46'),

The fort is a must-see attraction in Jaipur.\r\n\r\nSince there were no elephants at the fort and my tour included an elephant ride we went to the elephant\'s house and rode her around in a little open area in the neighborhood.

The driver\'s get commission if the tourists buy anything so they always want to stop at these places.\r\n\r\nBlock Printing is done by dipping a wooden block with a pattern on it into some organic ink and stamping the cloth with it repeatedly until it is covered.  Each block must be lined up precisely with the previous stamp.  They repeat the process many time with different blocks and different colors until the pattern is finished.\r\n\r\nThe next stop was the Monkey Temple which is at the top of a hill and you have to walk up to it.

The cobra would strike but they had pulled out his teeth.\r\n\r\nOn the way back from the Monkey Temple, I got off at the Hawa Mahal - Wind Palace and let the driver go home.

Note: even as a tourist, you should always walk clockwise around the stupa and all other Buddhist sites.\r\n\r\nSave some time for shopping: Boudha is an excellent place to pick up a few souvenirs.

Tuktuk is everywhere. Try it once or twice but be aware that when heat and dust are combined, it’s not glamorous.  The best way to get around is to take an Uber. It can be way cheaper than taking a tuktuk because drivers would charge you more since you’re a tourist.\r\n\r\nCost of hiring a car with a driver. You can get a car with a driver for $50-60 a day. That already includes his own accommodation and food. You don’t have to worry about that but you should book your own hotel or hostel. Give him your itinerary and be flexible about it. He might know something that is worth seeing along the way. Keep an open mind. Where can you rent a car? There are many of them online – google it.\r\n\r\nDay 1 – Colombo \r\n\r\nI landed at 2:30 in the morning and arrived at my fabulous guest house at 3:30. I started my tour of the city at 11:00. The driver picked me up on time and I told him to show me the city. In other words, I let him, the local, showed me around – and he didn’t disappoint me.\r\n\r\nPlaces we visited: Independence Memorial Museum Park, Saleem Malaka Buddhist Temple, The Fort, and some other markets and crowded places. Then, at 4 in the afternoon, I told him to drop me off at Peetah where I had my own walking tour. This is a place where Buddhist temples, Hindu temples and Christian churches are all within reach to each other. Peetah is a huge and crowded market and I managed to see these places: Jami-Ul-Alfar Mosque, Asokaramaya Buddhist and Hindu Temple, Old and New Kathiresan Hindu Temple and Wolvendaal Church.\r\n\r\nWhere to stay in Colombo. I had a fabulous stay at Mahazen by Foozoo. The place feels like home and welcoming. If only I had known that they could help me in renting a car and driver, too, I would have done that. So, when you book, ask them if they could help you with the itinerary.\r\n\r\nDay 2 – Colombo to Sigiriya\r\n\r\nFrom Colombo to Pinnnnawala Elephant Orphanage is about less than 90 kilometers – but guess what – it took us almost 4 hours to reach there! Aside from the fact that our tiny van was slow, the road was also narrow and traffic was really terrible! Then, before sunset, we hiked up to Dambulla Cave Temple. We arrived in my accommodation in Sigiraya at around 7 in the evening.\r\n\r\nWhere to stay in Sigiriya. I stayed at Darshani Lodge because it’s just less than two kilometres away to and from Sigiriya Rock and Pidurangala Rock. It’s clean and the room was spacious. The staff are very hospitable, too.\r\n\r\nDay 3 – Sigiriya to Kandy\r\n\r\nI woke up early in the morning and by 7:30, I was already at the entrance of Sigiriya Rock. To avoid the heat, morning time is the best time to climb the country’s famous rock. By 10:30 o’clock, I was on my way to Pidurangala Rock. Amazingly, with a good night sleep, I wasn’t that tired climbing two rocks one after the other. We left Sigiriya at 2:30 in the afternoon and arrived at Kandy at 6:30 PM (90 kilometres). And oh, in Matale, we stopped at this really amazing and mind-blowing Hindu Temple called Arulmidu Sri Muthumariamman Thevasthanam.\r\n\r\nWhere to stay in Kandy. I slept in a room with a fantastic view of Kandy – at Kandyan View Holiday Bungalow. I even had my own veranda from my room. The dining tables have an amazing view of the city, too.\r\n\r\nDAY 4 – Kandy to Nuwara Eliya\r\n\r\nWe checked out early and went straight to Kandy’s most famous tourist attraction – The Temple of the Tooth. I walked around the lake and the town until I got tired. I told the driver to just go wherever he wanted to go and I’d call him when I was ready to go.\r\n\r\nOn our way to Nuwara Eliya, we stopped in some of places where the hill views where fantastic. We’ve seen and passed by cascading waterfalls, panoramic tea plantations, a narrow and zigzag road that can be dangerous. We stopped by for an hour at Blue Field Tea Plantation to learn about tea and for the amazing photo shoot – of myself! 😀 As we snaked our way up the hills, valleys and mountains, the temperature got chilly, too.\r\n\r\nWe arrived at Nuwara Eliya at 3 pm. I walked around Victoria Park and the small city on my own while the driver had his long lunch break. 😀 I actually didn’t mind it.\r\n\r\nWhere to stay in Nuwara Eliya. The House of Leisure is an amazing place to stay in. The place itself is overlooking the emerald tea plantation – and it’s stunning! Stay here not just for its incredible view but also for its amazing staff and nice dinner.\r\n \r\nDAY 5 – By Train from Nuwara Eliya to Ella and to Udawalawe National Park\r\n\r\nI woke up early to go down to San Pedro Tea Estate. I was the only one exploring it while I was blanketed by the morning mists. It’s so serene and calm. After breakfast, the driver dropped me off at the train station before 9:30 to catch a slow train to Ella for 4 hours. I told him to pick me up at Ella Train Station.\r\n\r\nTrain from Nuwara Eliya to Ella. There’s a slow train that leaves at 9:30 AM (4 hours). The fast train (2 hours and a half) leaves at 10:30. I chose to ride a train for the stunning views along the way. And of course, to experience how the locals move on a train. It was crowded and passengers are allowed to sit anywhere. I literally sat on the train’s open door, with my legs comfortably hanging outside. Cool experience. But, yeah, can be dangerous, too.\r\n\r\nWhen I arrived at Ella Train Station, the driver had already been waiting for two hours. He whisked me right away to Lipton’s Seat. And boy, the drive going up there was the best ride / drive ever! It’s indescribable! You’ve got to see and experience it yourself – to believe it!\r\n\r\nWe arrived at Udawalawe National Park at 8:30 in the evening. Yes, it was loooong drive!\r\n\r\nWhere to stay at Udawalawe National Park. Visitors come here because they want to do safari. And the best place to stay here is at Kottawata Village Hotel. It’s real good value for your bucks. Nice rooms, fabulous food, hammocks, swimming pool, landscaping, etc… They can also arrange a safari for you – riding on a jeep.\r\n\r\nDAY 6 – To Galle \r\n\r\nOur ride from the National Park to Galle was less traffic and road conditions were better. We had a couple of stops but mostly buying fresh coconut juice and a few temples. We finally arrived in Galle at 1 in the afternoon. I met a friend of mine I’ve never seen for 6 years and we had lunch together. We had our own walking tour around Galle Fort before we wrapped up our day at 7 in the evening\r\n\r\nWhere to stay in Weligama. Instead of staying at Galle, I chose to book a hostel in Weligama (30 minutes from Galle). However, the hostel I chose was not the one I expected it to be. There are, of course, many options in the area. Weligama Bay is known for its surfing activities (though the waves aren’t really that impressive) and beaches. Along the bay, you’ll find some fishermen on stilts, too – doing nothing but posing or “fishing” for money.\r\n\r\nDAY 7 – WELLIGAMA – GALLE – COLOMBO – NEGOMBO\r\n\r\nEarly in the morning, I walked for two hours along Weligama Bay (aka beach) where a lot of surfing boards and lessons were going on. It felt so good to have my feet drowned in sea salt and fine sand. A number of good and trying hard surfers were busy frolicking with the unimpressive waves. Fishermen were keeping their fish nets and pushing their fishing boats away from the shore. I sat for a while and when the heat burned my skin, I decided to go back to my hotel.\r\n\r\nOn our way back to Colombo, we had a stop at the Turtle Conservation Center and the Mask Museum. I was too tired when we finally arrived in Negombo – known for its beach resorts and golden sand. I didn’t have time to explore the place though, except going into two bars and a real good restaurant – Lords – for dinner.\r\n\r\nWhere to stay in Negombo. Gomez Place is a fabulous place to stay! The rooms are so spacious and well-decorated. I love their huge bathroom, too! And, oh, they’ve got a swimming pool, too!\r\n\r\nDAY 8 – GOODBYE SRI LANKA\r\nThe reason why I stayed at Negombo on my last night in Sri Lanka is that it’s just 15 minutes to the airport. And since I flew on a weekend, traffic was easy breezy – so we got in at the airport in less than 15 minutes!\r\n\r\nAnd that’s how my sojourn in Sri Lanka ended.', 1, 5, 1, 0, 0, 1, '2018-10-31', NULL, NULL, '2018-10-31 06:25:31', '2018-10-31 07:57:19'),

I had to go on the big highway for about 10 km.  There were a lot of truck and buses which make me nervous but the highway was nice and wide.\r\n\r\nI turned off the main road at the town of Aungpan.  The road was paved but very narrow so passing oncoming traffic was harrowing.  Luckily there were mostly motorcycles and not many four wheel vehicles which took up most of the road.  The pavement eventually ran out and so did the traffic.  I was mostly alone on the road except for occasional motorcycles and a few pedestrians.\r\n\r\nThe scenery was very nice with colorful fields and green hills.  I pulled off to enter a few temples and pagodas.  I went to one place with pagodas on the top of a hill.  I thought there would be a good view of the fields from the top so I attempted to climb up to the top.  The steep, narrow, and slippery path was covered with spiderwebs full of big spiders.  I made it almost to the top and then there was about 10 meters of path left that was covered in spider webs and big spiders up high in the trees.  It looked like something out of Indiana Jones.  I had a stick to clear the webs with but I was afraid that all of the spiders would drop down and be all over the place so I aborted and went back down the hill defeated.  I don\'t think that I\'ve ever been thwarted by spiders before.\r\n\r\nI continued on the motorbike in the direction of Inle Lake.  The road was so bad that I was worried about blowing a tire so I took it easy.  I passed one guy who had blown out a tire.  I stopped along the way for photo opps and finally got to the little village of Inlein (or Inn Dein or Indein).  The village was on a creek with boat access to Inle Lake but I didn\'t have time to take a boat ride and get the motorbike back to Kalaw by 17:30.  There was a good view from a hill of the lake and all the houses around it.\r\n\r\nIn the village, I went to the famous Nyaung Ohak Stupa site and the Shwe Inn Dein Pagoda at the top.  There are thousands of stupas at this place, some crumbling and some in good shape.  There are also souvenir stalls all the way up to the pagoda.\r\n\r\nThe ride back to Kalaw at about 16:00 was fun because of all the farmers were heading home.  There were trucks full of ladies in their traditional garb, oxcarts, and farmers walking their water buffaloes home with the kids riding on them. \r\n\r\nBack in Kalaw I turned in the motorcycle.  One of the mirrors had fallen off and the lady noticed it immediately.  I told her that it shook off and I had it in my backpack so she was okay with that.  The other big hassle with the motorbike was that the fuel gauge didn\'t work so I couldn\'t tell how much fuel there was.  I filled it up twice just in case.

We walked over to one of the many river canals to get into his boat.\r\n\r\nWe had a nice afternoon of speeding around the lake and going to different temples and shopping places.  He kept taking me to shopping places where he would get a commission if I bought anything which I didn\'t as usual.  There were also tons of souvenir stalls at each temple or pagoda that we stopped at.  We stopped at a big restaurant on stilts with great views for lunch.  I had a hot and spicy fish curry that was probably fresh out of the lake. \r\n\r\nThe lake was full of speeding boats both with tourists and locals doing their business.  It was very scenic with villages full of stilt houses.  The famous leg-rowing fisherman who paddle with one leg and hold a big basket to catch fish with were around.  Mostly it was a show for the tourists like the stilt fishermen in Sri Lanka.  I did see that some of them were doing it for real off in the distance by themselves.\r\n\r\nAt sunset all the tourist boats gathered around at one end of the lake and the fisherman did their show for tips.  Then all the boats sped back into town to dump us out.', 1, 4, 72, 1, 1, 0, '2018-11-18', NULL, NULL, '2018-11-18 19:51:42', '2019-02-25 16:45:34'),

Walk five minutes out of town to the Nam Tha river, cross the bamboo bridge (washed out in the middle of wet season but rebuilt a few months later) and visit the traditional Tai Dam villages with their charming local crops on the riverbanks.  The Tai Dam minority tribe are well known in Laos for their weaving abilities, and you can often see them weaving in the village, or sometimes even getting the silk off their silkworms.  Walk out further to the left and explore some nearby sticky rice paddies.\r\n\r\n2. Walk about 10-15 minutes (5 minute cycle) to the new golden stupa on the hill behind the town. It has some cool Buddha statues behind it and gives an amazing view of the rice filled valley surrounded by mountains.  If you get up early enough this is the best place to watch the sunrise, and in winter the mist rise off the mountains.  There is a trail at the back right of the stupa that goes up through rubber plantations and villagers crops to a very high mountain that rewards the climb with panoramic views of the town, rice paddies and surrounding mountains and jungle.  You can also bike the newly sealed road in front of the temple (at the foot of the stupa) out into the countryside to the old ruined stupa; a very scenic trip.\r\n\r\n3. Rent a scooter or bicycle and travel 6 km out of town to the Lanten minority village of Ban Nam Dee.  Explore the village with its thatched bamboo houses and traditionally dressed residents who hand make their indigo blue clothing.  If you are lucky the women will be making bamboo paper in the river by hand which can also be purchased.  Take the 10 minute walk on a good path through the jungle up to the nearby small waterfall; which is pleasant and worth the trip.\r\n\r\n4. Travel 2 km north out of town, cross the roundabout and ride 5km out on the main road to be in the middle of a huge “ocean” of rice paddies bordered on all sides by mountains.  This stunning scene is dotted with bamboo huts made by the rice farmers and you can follow the little trails out to them and chill out in the huts and witness the peace and the wildlife rich rice paddy ecosystem.  Insects and birds are found out there in abundance.  A great place to read a book, take a picnic and watch the sunset over the mountains.\r\n\r\n5. Do a minority village trail; get a map then on scooter or bicycle go out to visit some different minority villages on your own as a cultural trail.  You can visit the different ethnic minorities of Ahka, Black Tai, Khmu, Lanten, Tai Lue and Pounoy villages all in one day, thus witnessing first hand their different cultures, traditions, style of housing and clothing, cooking methods and languages.  All of these tribes co-exist peacefully together in Luang Namtha.\r\n\r\n6. Take a scooter or motorbike 60 km north towards Muang Sing.  You will pass through the stunning, densely jungle-clad mountains of the Namha NPA, where you can walk a few km through the jungle to a beautiful little waterfall.  This you will find about 10 km before you reach Muang Sing, on the right hand side of the road, clearly signposted.  There is little traffic on this road and many scenic spots to stop including some ethnic minority villages.\r\n\r\n7. There are various little trails down from around Luang Namtha town to get to the river where it is not only beautiful but a good place to take a dip and a wander along its banks.\r\n\r\nAlso another must do in the town is to chill out in the soft chairs of Forest Retreat Laos’s Bamboo Lounge using the super-fast Wifi with a good cocktail, sweet tunes and an authentic wood-fired pizza.', 1, 5, 2, 0, 0, 1, '2018-12-04', NULL, NULL, '2018-12-04 05:09:36', '2018-12-08 18:26:46'),
