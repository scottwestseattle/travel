How to Submit Documents
In some cases, Washington Healthplanfinder needs additional information about your household so you can enroll in coverage. This is called being “conditionally eligible” and it happens when the systems that check your application can’t confirm some of your information.

If you’re conditionally eligible and don’t submit documents before the deadline, you and others in your household could lose your health insurance or the amount of financial help you’re getting could change.

Accepted Documents
Use the sections below to find the most common types of accepted documents for each category. There are also forms to download when you can’t submit the recommended documents. See a full list of accepted documents.

Proof of Income or Deductions
You’ll need to provide proof of income for each household member on your application.

Some example documents that prove income include:

Payroll statements for the last 60 days
The first 2 pages your most recent tax return
Self-employment Profit and Loss document for the past 3 months
Receipts showing recent payment of reported deductions
What will happen if you miss the deadline?

After the deadline, we’ll verify your income using federal and state data that is available from the IRS and the Washington State Department of Employment Security. You could lose your tax credits or the amount of tax credits you’re eligible for could change.

I cannot provide proof of business income or deductions for three months because I have just started a new busines running a travel web site.  It has been running for only one month and I expect the income to be very low for the first two years.  Deductions will vary greatly month to month depending on my travel expenses.  I will be travelling 100% of the time for the remainder of 2018.  In addition to business income I have interest income that is shown in the information below.
